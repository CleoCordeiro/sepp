Summary
------------------------------------
This repository includes code for SEPP, TIPP, and UPP.  The three methods use ensembles of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in different ways, each focusing on a different problem. 

Each of these related tools have their own README files .

[README.SEPP.md](README.SEPP.md)
* **SEPP** stands for "SATe-enabled Phylogenetic Placement", and addresses the problem of phylogenetic placement of short reads into reference alignments and trees. 

[README.TIPP.md](README.TIPP.md)
* **TIPP** stands for "Taxonomic Identification and Phylogenetic Profiling", and addresses the problem of taxonomic identification and abundance profiling of metagenomic data. 

[README.UPP.md](README.UPP.md)
* **UPP** stands for "Ultra-large alignments using Phylogeny-aware Profiles", and addresses the problem of alignment of very large datasets, potentially containing fragmentary data. UPP can align datasets with up to 1,000,000 sequences.

Bugs and Errors
---------------------------------------------
SEPP, TIPP, and UPP are under active research development at UTCS and UIUC by the Warnow Lab (and especially with her PhD student Siavash Mirarab and postdoc Nam Nguyen). Please report any errors to Siavash Mirarab (smirarab@gmail.com) and Nam Nguyen (namphuon@illinois.edu).
