Summary
------------------------------------
This repository includes code for SEPP, TIPP, and UPP.  The three methods use the ensembles of Hidden Markov models (HMM) in order
to address three different problems.

Each of these related tools have their own README files .

[README.SEPP.md](README.SEPP.md)
* **SEPP** stands for "SATe-enabled phylogenetic placement", and addresses the problem of phylogenetic placement of short reads into reference alignment and trees. 

[README.TIPP.md](README.TIPP.md)
* **TIPP** stands for "Taxonomic identification and phylogenetic profiling", and addresses the problem of taxonomic identification and profiling of metagenomic data. 

[README.UPP.md](README.UPP.md)
* **UPP** stands for "Ultra-large alignments using Phylogeny-aware Profiles", and addresses the problem of alignment of very large datasets.

Bugs and Errors
---------------------------------------------
SEPP, TIPP, and UPP iare under active research development at UTCS and UIUC by the Warnow Lab (and especially with her PhD student Siavash Mirarab and Post-Doc Nam Nguyen). Please report any errors to Siavash Mirarab (smirarab@gmail.com) and Nam Nguyen (namphuon@cs.utexas.edu).
